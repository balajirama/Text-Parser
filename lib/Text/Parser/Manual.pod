# PODNAME: Text::Parser::Manual

# ABSTRACT: A manual for the Text::Parser class

=head1 MOTIVATION

Text parsing is perhaps the single most common thing that almost every Perl program does. Yet we don't have a lean, flexible, text parsing utility. Ideally, the developer should only have to specify the "grammar" of the text file she intends to parse. Everything else, like C<open>ing a file handle, C<close>ing the file handle, tracking line-count, joining continued lines into one, reporting any errors in line continuation, trimming white space, splitting each line into fields, etc., should be automatic.

Unfortunately however, most file parsing code looks like this:

    open FH, "<$fname";
    my $line_count = 0;
    while (<FH>) {
        $line_count++;
        chomp;
        $_ = trim $_;  ## From String::Util
        my (@fields) = split /\s+/;
        # do something for each line ...
    }
    close FH;

Note that a developer may have to repeat all of the above if she has to read another file with different content or format. And if the target text format allows line-wrapping with a continuation character, it isn't easy to implement it well with the above C<while> loop. Furthermore, the part that is not shown in the above code C<# do something for each line ...> can actually be quite complex with several cascading if-else blocks.

    if ($fields[0] eq 'NAME:') {
        # something
    } elsif ($fields[0] eq 'ADDRESS:') {
        # something else
    } elsif ($fields[0] eq 'EMAIL:') {
    .
    .
    .
    } else {
        # finally!
    }

There are several problems with this sort of code. For starters, it is:

=for :list
* Hard to refactor and simplify into small functions (See I<"Clean Code"> by Robert C. Martin).
* Cannot be easily modified and re-used for another very similar text format.
* Complex conditions are harder to write and often result in nested conditions.
* Documenting code in the while loop can get rather hairy.

=head1 VISION

What if:

=for :list
* a utility took care of all the "mundane" boilerplate like C<open>, C<close> etc.?
* parsing line-wrapped files were as simple as writing a small function that joins lines to unwrap?
* data extraction could be done with a set of self-explanatory rules that don't need to be documented?
* the resulting code "reads like well-written prose"?
* developers could easily extend a text parser written by another developer?

L<Text::Parser> can help you accomplish all of these and more!

The programmer needs to specify a set of parsing rules which look quite like AWK. And the rest is all taken care of. So now, a programmer need only focus on the grammar of the file they intend to parse.

=head1 CHAPTERS

This manual is divided into chapters:

=for :list
* L<Text::Parser::Manual::ComparingWithNativePerl> - this chapter should explain why one should consider using L<Text::Parser> instead of native Perl.
* L<Text::Parser::Manual::ExtendedAWKSyntax> - this chapter outlines the syntax for the rules

You can L<start here|Text::Parser::Manual::ExtendedAWKSyntax>.
