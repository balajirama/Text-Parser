# ABSTRACT: Simplifies text parsing. Easily extensible to parse any text format.

use Exporter 'import';
our (@EXPORT_OK) = ();
our (@EXPORT)    = (@EXPORT_OK);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Parser;

    my $parser = Text::Parser->new();
    $parser->read(shift);
    print $parser->get_records, "\n";

The above code reads the first command-line argument as a string, and assuming it is the name of a text file, it will print the content of the file to C<STDOUT>. If the string is not the name of a text file it will throw an exception and exit.

    package MyParser;

    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    ## or use Moose; extends 'Text::Parser';

    sub save_record {
        my $self = shift;
        ## ...
    }

    package main;

    my $parser = MyParser->new(auto_split => 1, auto_chomp => 1, auto_trim => 'b');
    $parser->read(shift);
    foreach my $rec ($parser->get_records) {
        ## ...
    }

The above example shows how C<Text::Parser> could be easily extended to parse a specific text format.

=head1 RATIONALE

Text parsing is perhaps the single most common thing that almost every Perl program does. Yet we don't have a lean, flexible, text parsing utility. Ideally, the developer should only have to specify the "grammar" of the text file she intends to parse. Everything else, like C<open>ing a file handle, C<close>ing the file handle, tracking line-count, joining continued lines into one, reporting any errors in line continuation, trimming white space, splitting each line into fields, etc., should be automatic.

Unfortunately however, how most file parsing code looks like this:

    open FH, "<$fname";
    my $line_count = 0;
    while (<FH>) {
        $line_count++;
        chomp;
        $_ = trim $_;  ## From String::Util
        my (@fields) = split /\s+/;
        # do something for each line ...
    }
    close FH;

Note that a developer may have to repeat all of the above if she has to read another file with different content or format. And if the text has line-continuation characters, it isn't easy to implement it well with the C<while> loop above.

With C<Text::Parser>, developers can focus on specifying the grammar and simply use the C<read> method. Just inherit the class and override one method (C<L<save_record|/save_record>>). Voila! you have a parser. L<These examples|/EXAMPLES> illustrate how easy this can be.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Text::Parser> is a format-agnostic text parsing utility class. Derived classes can specify the format-specific syntax they intend to parse. Usually just methods needs to be overridden to do this. But of course derived classes can create any additional attributes or methods needed to interpret the fomart and extract records.

Future versions are expected to include progress-bar support, parsing text from sockets, UTF support, or parsing from a chunk of memory. All these software features are text-format independent and should be re-used. Derived classes of C<Text::Parser> will be able to take advantage of these features seamlessly, while the base class handles the "mundane" details.

=constr new

Takes optional attributes in the form of a hash. See section L<ATTRIBUTES|/ATTRIBUTES> for a list of the attributes and their description. Throws an exception if you use wrong inputs to create an object.

    my $parser = Text::Parser->new(
        auto_chomp      => 0,           # 0 (Default) or 1
                                        #   - automatically chomp lines
        multiline_type  => 'join_last', # 'join_last'|'join_next'|undef ; Default: undef

                                        #   - automatically trim leading and trailing whitespaces
        auto_split      => 1,           # Auto-splits lines into fields
        field_separator => qr/\s+/,     # Used by auto_split feature above. Default: qr/\s+/
    );

This C<$parser> variable will be used in all examples below.

sub BUILD {
    my $self = shift;
    ensure_all_roles $self, 'Text::Parser::AutoSplit' if $self->auto_split;
    return if not defined $self->multiline_type;
    ensure_all_roles $self, 'Text::Parser::Multiline';
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The attributes below can be used as options to the C<new> constructor. Each attribute has an accessor with the same name.

=attr auto_chomp

Read-write attribute. Takes a boolean value as parameter. Defaults to 0.

    print "Parser will chomp lines automatically\n" if $parser->auto_chomp;

=cut

has auto_chomp => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => 0,
);

=attr auto_split

Read-only attribute that can be set only during object construction. This attribute indicates if the parser will automatically split every line into fields. If it is set to a true value, each line will be split into fields which can be accessed through special methods that become available. These methods are documented in L<Text::Parser::AutoSplit>. The field separator can be set using another attribute named C<'field_separator'>. Defaults to 0.

=cut

has auto_split => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => 0,
);

=attr auto_trim

Read-write attribute. The values this can take are shown under the C<L<new|/new>> constructor also. Defaults to C<'n'> (neither side spaces will be trimmed).

    $parser->auto_trim('l');       # 'l' (left), 'r' (right), 'b' (both), 'n' (neither) (Default)

=cut

has auto_trim => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Text::Parser::Types::TrimType',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => 'n',
);

=attr FS

Read-write attribute that can be used to specify the field separator along with C<auto_split> attribute. It must be a regular expression reference enclosed in the C<qr> function, like C<qr/\s+|[,]/> which will split across either spaces or commas. The default value for this argument is C<qr/\s+/>.

The name for this attribute comes from the built-in C<FS> variable in the popular GNU Awk program.

    $parser->FS( qr/\s+\(*|\s*\)/ );

You I<can> change the field separator in the course of parsing a file. But the changes would take effect only on the next line. For example:

    package MyParser;

    use Moose;
    extends 'Text::Parser';

    sub BUILDARGS {
        return {
            auto_split => 1,
            auto_chomp => 1,
            auto_trim => 'b'
        };
    }

    sub save_record {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->FS(qr/[,]/) if $self->field(0) eq 'CSV_BELOW';
        $self->SUPER::save_record([$self->fields]);
    }

    package main;

    use Data::Dumper 'Dumper';

    my $parser = MyParser->new();
    $parser->read('input.txt');
    print Dumper([$parser->get_records]), "\n";

Now, let us say you have a file F<input.txt> with the following content:

    Some information in this file
    CSV_BELOW
    col1,col2,col3
    data1,1,1
    data2,2,4
    data3,3,9

Then the output will be:

    $VAR1 = [
        [ 'Some', 'information', 'in', 'this', 'file' ],
        [ 'CSV_BELOW' ], 
        [ 'col1', 'col2', 'col3' ], 
        [ 'data1', '1', '1' ], 
        [ 'data2', '2', '4' ], 
        [ 'data3', '3', '9' ]
    ]; 

=cut

has FS => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'RegexpRef',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => sub {qr/\s+/},
);

=attr multiline_type

Read-write attribute. Takes a value that is either C<undef> or one of strings C<'join_next'> or C<'join_last'>.

    my $mult = $parser->multiline_type;
    print "Parser is a multi-line parser of type: $mult" if defined $mult;

    $parser->multiline_type(undef);
                        # setting this to undef will throw an exception if it was previously set to a real value like
                        # 'join_next' or 'join_last'. In this case, since $parser was of 'join_last' type, there will
                        # be an exception
    $parser->multiline_type('join_next');
                        # Changes the parser to a multiline parser of type 'join_next'
                        # This is okay.

=head3 What value should I choose?

If your text format allows users to break up what should be on a single line into another line using a continuation character, you need to use the C<multiline_type> option. The option tells the parser to join lines back into a single line, so that your C<save_record> method doesn't have to bother about joining the continued lines, stripping any continuation characters, line-feeds etc. There are two variations in this:

=for :list
* If your format allows something like a trailing back-slash or some other character to indicate that text on I<B<next>> line is to be joined with this one, then choose C<join_next>. See L<this example|/"Continue with character">.
* If your format allows some character to indicate that text on the current line is part of the I<B<last>> line, then choose C<join_last>. See L<this simple SPICE line-joiner|/"Simple SPICE line joiner"> as an example. B<Note:> If you have no continuation character, but you want to just join all the lines into one single line and then call C<save_record> only once for the whole text block, then use C<join_last>. See L<this trivial line-joiner|/"Trivial line-joiner">.

Remember that C<join_next> multi-line parsers will blindly look for input to be continued on the next line, even if C<EOF> has been reached. This means, if you want to "slurp" a file into a single large string, without any continuation characters, you must use the C<join_last> multi-line type.

=cut

has multiline_type => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Text::Parser::Types::MultilineType|Undef',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => undef,
);

around multiline_type => sub {
    my ( $orig, $self ) = ( shift, shift );
    return $orig->($self) if not @_;
    return $orig->( $self, shift ) if not defined $orig->($self);

        if not defined $newval;
    ensure_all_roles $self, 'Text::Parser::Multiline';
    $orig->( $self, $newval );
};

=deprecated setting

This method has been deprecated. Use C<multiline_type> and C<auto_chomp> instead.

I<(Note: This deprecated method cannot be used with the >C<auto_trim>I< attribute)>

I<This method will disappear from version 1.0 onwards.>

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    return if not @_;
    my $setting = shift;
    my %allowed = ( multiline_type => 1, auto_chomp => 1 );
    return if not exists $allowed{$setting};
    return $self->$setting();
}

=method read

Takes zero or one argument which could be a string containing the name of the file, or a filehandle reference (a C<GLOB>) like C<\*STDIN> or an object of the C<L<FileHandle>> class. Throws an exception if filename/C<GLOB> provided is either non-existent or cannot be read for any reason.

B<Note:> Normally if you provide the C<GLOB> of a file opened for write, some Operating Systems allow reading from it too, and some don't. Read the documentation for C<L<filehandle|/filehandle>> for more on this.

    $parser->read($filename);

    # The above is equivalent to the following
    $parser->filename($filename);
    $parser->read();

    # You can also read from a previously opened file handle directly
    $parser->filehandle(\*STDIN);
    $parser->read();

Returns once all records have been read or if an exception is thrown for any parsing errors, or if reading has been aborted with the C<L<abort_reading|/abort_reading>> method.

If you provide a filename as input, the function will handle all C<open> and C<close> operations on files even if any exception is thrown, or if the reading has been aborted. But if you pass a file handle C<GLOB> or C<FileHandle> object instead, then the file handle won't be closed and it will be the responsibility of the calling program to close the filehandle.

    $parser->read('myfile.txt');
    # Will handle open, parsing, and closing of file automatically.

    open MYFH, "<myfile.txt" or die "Can't open file myfile.txt at ";
    $parser->read(\*MYFH);
    # Will not close MYFH and it is the respo
    close MYFH;

When you do read a new file name or file handle with this method, you will lose all the records stored from the previous read operation. So this means that if you want to read a different file with the same parser object, (unless you don't care about the records from the last file you read) you should use the C<L<get_records|/get_records>> method to retrieve all the read records before parsing a new file. So all those calls to C<read> in the example above were parsing three different files, and each successive call overwrote the records from the previous call.

    $parser->read($file1);
    my (@records) = $parser->get_records();

    $parser->read(\*STDIN);
    my (@stdin) = $parser->get_records();

B<Note:> To extend the class to other file formats, override C<L<save_record|/save_record>> instead of this one.

=head3 Future Enhancement

I<At present the C<read> method takes only two possible inputs argument types, either a file name, or a file handle. In future this may be enhanced to read from sockets, subroutines, or even just a block of memory (a string reference). Suggestions for other forms of input are welcome.>

=cut

sub read {
    my $self = shift;
    return if not defined $self->_handle_read_inp(@_);
    $self->__read_and_close_filehandle;

    return $self->filename($inp) if not ref($inp);
    return $self->filehandle($inp)
        if ref($inp) eq 'GLOB'
        or ( defined blessed($inp) and blessed($inp) eq 'FileHandle' );
    throw_bad_input_to_read error => "$inp is an unknown type of input";
}

    my $self = shift;

}

sub __try_to_parse {
    my ( $self, $line ) = @_;
    try { $self->save_record($line); }
    finally { }
}

=method filename

Takes zero or one string argument containing the name of a file. Returns the name of the file that was last opened if any. Returns C<undef> if no file has been opened.

    print "Last read ", $parser->filename, "\n";

The file name is "persistent" in the object. Meaning, even after you have called C<L<read|/read>> once, it still remembers the file name. So you can do this:

    $parser->read(shift @ARGV);
    print $parser->filename(), ":\n",
          "=" x (length($parser->filename())+1),
          "\n",
          $parser->get_records(),
          "\n";

But if you do a C<read> with a filehandle as argument, you'll see that the last filename is lost - which makes sense.

    $parser->read(\*MYFH);
    print "Last file name is lost\n" if not defined $parser->filename();

=cut

has filename => (
    is        => 'rw',
    isa       => 'Text::Parser::Types::FileReadable|Undef',
    lazy      => 1,
    init_arg  => undef,
    default   => undef,
    predicate => '_has_filename',
    clearer   => '_clear_filename',
    trigger   => \&_set_filehandle,
);

sub _set_filehandle {
    my $self = shift;
    my $fh   = FileHandle->new( $self->filename, 'r' );
    return $self->_save_filehandle($fh);
}

=method filehandle

Takes zero or one argument that must be either a filehandle C<GLOB> (such as C<\*STDIN>) or an object of the C<FileHandle> class. The method saves it for future a C<L<read|/read>> call. Returns the filehandle last saved, or C<undef> if none was saved. Remember that after a successful C<read> call, filehandles are lost.

    my $fh = $parser->filehandle();

Like in the case of C<L<filename|/filename>> method, if after you C<read> with a filehandle, you call C<read> again, this time with a file name, the last filehandle is lost.

    my $lastfh = $parser->filehandle();
    ## Will return STDOUT
    
    $parser->read('another.txt');
    print "No filehandle saved any more\n" if
                        not defined $parser->filehandle();

=cut

has filehandle => (
    is        => 'rw',
    isa       => 'FileHandle|Undef',
    lazy      => 1,

    default   => undef,
    predicate => '_has_filehandle',
    writer    => '_save_filehandle',
    reader    => '_get_filehandle',
    clearer   => '_close_filehandles',
);

sub filehandle {
    my $self = shift;
    return if not @_ and not $self->_has_filehandle;
    $self->_save_filehandle(@_) if @_;
    $self->_clear_filename if @_;
    my $fh = $self->_get_filehandle;
    return $fh;
}

=method lines_parsed

Takes no arguments. Returns the number of lines last parsed. A line is reckoned when the C<\n> character is encountered.

    print $parser->lines_parsed, " lines were parsed\n";

The value is auto-updated during the execution of C<L<read|/read>>. See L<this example|/"Example 2 : Error checking"> of how this can be used in derived classes.

Again the information in this is "persistent". But you can also be assured that every time you call C<read>, the value be auto-reset before parsing.

=cut

has lines_parsed => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Int',
    lazy     => 1,
    init_arg => undef,
    default  => 0,
    traits   => ['Counter'],
    handles  => {
        _next_line_parsed => 'inc',
        _reset_line_count => 'reset',
    }
);

=inherit save_record

Takes exactly one argument and that is saved as a record. Additional arguments are ignored. If no arguments are passed, then C<undef> is stored as a record.

In an application that uses a text parser, you will most-likely never call this method directly. It is automatically called within C<L<read|/read>> for each line. In this base class C<Text::Parser>, C<save_record> is simply called with a string containing the raw line of text ; i.e. the line of text will not be C<chomp>ed or modified in any way (unless of course the C<auto_chomp> attribute is turned on). L<Here|/"Example 1 : A simple CSV Parser"> is a basic example.

Derived classes can decide to store records in a different form. A derived class could, for example, store the records in the form of hash references (so that when you use C<L<get_records|/get_records>>, you'd get an array of hashes), or maybe even another array reference (so when you use C<get_records> you'd get an array of arrays). The L<CSV parser example|/"Example 1 : A simple CSV Parser"> does the latter.

=cut

sub save_record {
    my ( $self, $record ) = ( shift, shift );
    $self->push_records($record);
}

=inherit line_auto_manip

A method that could be overridden to manipulate each line before it gets to C<save_record> method. Because this is called before the C<save_record> method, it is called even before the C<Text::Parser::Multiline> role can be called. You will almost never call this method in a program directly but might use it in subclasses.

The default implementation C<chomp>s lines (if C<auto_chomp> is true) and trims leading/trailing whitespace (if C<auto_trim> is not C<'n'>).

If you override this method, remember that it takes a string as input and returns a string.

=cut

sub line_auto_manip {
    my ( $self, $line ) = ( shift, shift );
    return if not defined $line;
    chomp $line if $self->auto_chomp;
    return $self->_trim_line($line);
}

sub _trim_line {
    my ( $self, $line ) = ( shift, shift );
    return $line        if $self->auto_trim eq 'n';
    return trim($line)  if $self->auto_trim eq 'b';
    return ltrim($line) if $self->auto_trim eq 'l';
    return rtrim($line);
}

=method get_records

Takes no arguments. Returns an array containing all the records saved by the parser.

    foreach my $record ( $parser->get_records ) {
        $i++;
        print "Record: $i: ", $record, "\n";
    }

=cut

=sub_use_method abort_reading

Takes no arguments. Returns C<1>. You will probably never call this method in your main program.

This method is usually used only in the derived class. See L<this example|/"Example 3 : Aborting without errors">.

=cut

=method has_aborted

Takes no arguments, returns a boolean to indicate if text reading was aborted in the middle.

    print "Aborted\n" if $parser->has_aborted();

=cut

has abort => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    lazy    => 1,

    reader  => 'has_aborted',
    handles => {
        abort_reading => 'set',
        _clear_abort  => 'unset'
    },
);

=method pop_record

Takes no arguments and pops the last saved record.

    my $last_rec = $parser->pop_record;
    $uc_last = uc $last_rec;
    $parser->save_record($uc_last);

=cut

sub last_record {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $count = $self->_num_records();
    return if not $count;
    return $self->_access_record( $count - 1 );
}

=dont_touch_method push_records

Don't override this method unless you know what you're doing. This method is useful if you have to copy the records from another parser. It is a general-purpose method for storing records that have been prepared before-hand. It is not supposed to be used to modify the arguments and make records (like C<L<save_record|/save_record>> does).

    $parser->push_records(
        $another_parser->get_records
    );

=inherit is_line_continued

This method is to be defined by the derived class and is used only for multi-line parsers. Look under L<FOR MULTI-LINE TEXT PARSING|/"FOR MULTI-LINE TEXT PARSING"> for details.

=multiline_method is_line_continued

Takes a string argument and returns a boolean indicating of the line is continued or not. If the user defines a new text format with multi-line support, they should implement this method. An example implementation would look like this:

    sub is_line_continued {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        chomp $line;
        $line =~ /\\\s*$/;
    }

The above example method checks if a line is being continued by using a back-slash character (C<\>).

The default method provided in this class will return C<0> if the parser is not a multi-line parser. If it is a multi-line parser, return value depends on the type of multiline parser. If it is of type C<'join_last'>, then it returns C<1> for all lines except the first line. This means all lines continue from the previous line (except the first line, because there is no line before that). But if it is of type C<'join_next'>, then it returns C<1> for all lines unconditionally. B<Note:> This means the parser will expect further lines, even when the last line in the text input has been read. Thus you need to have a way to indicate that there is no further continuation. This is why if you are building a trivial line-joiner, you should use the C<'join_last'> type. See L<this example|/"Trivial line-joiner">

Most users would never need to use this method in their own programs, but if one is writing a parser for a specific format that supports multi-line extension, mostly they'd have to implement it.

=cut

sub is_line_continued {
    my $self = shift;
    return 0 if not defined $self->multiline_type;
    return 0
        if $self->multiline_type eq 'join_last'
        and $self->lines_parsed() == 1;
    return 1;
}

=multiline_method join_last_line

This method can be overridden in multi-line text parsing. The method takes two string arguments and joins them in a way that removes the continuation character. The default implementation just concatenates two strings and returns the result without removing anything. You should redefine this method to strip any continuation characters and join the strings with any required spaces. Below is an example of a method which strips the ending back-slash continuation characters, that were detected in the C<L<is_line_continued|/is_line_continued>> method above.

    sub join_last_line {
        my $self = shift;
        my ($last, $line) = (shift, shift);
        $last =~ s/\\\s*$//g;
        return "$last $line";
    }

=cut

sub join_last_line {
    my $self = shift;
    my ( $last, $line ) = ( shift, shift );
    return $last . $line;
}

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Basic principle

Derived classes simply need to override one method : C<L<save_record|/save_record>>. With the help of that any arbitrary file format can be read. C<save_record> should interpret the format of the text and store it in some form by calling C<SUPER::save_record>. The C<main::> program will then use the records and create an appropriate data structure with it.

Notice that the creation of a data structure is not the objective of a parser. It is simply concerned with collecting data and arranging it in a form that can be used. That's all. Data structures can be created by a different part of your program using the data collected by your parser.

B<Note:> There is support for L<Moose>. So you could use C<extends 'Text::Parser'> instead of the C<use parent> pragma in these examples. The examples in this documentation will show non-L<Moose> classic Perl OO derived classes for ease of understanding. Those who know how to C<use> class automators like L<Moo>/L<Moose> should be able to follow.

=head2 Example 1 : A simple CSV Parser

We will write a parser for a simple CSV file that reads each line and stores the records as array references. This example is oversimplified, and does B<not> handle embedded newlines.

    package Text::Parser::CSV;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    use Text::CSV;

    my $csv;
    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        $csv //= Text::CSV->new({ binary => 1, auto_diag => 1});
        $csv->parse($line);
        $self->SUPER::save_record([$csv->fields]);
    }

That's it! Now in C<main::> you can write something like this:

    use Text::Parser::CSV;
    
    my $csvp = Text::Parser::CSV->new();
    $csvp->read(shift @ARGV);
    foreach my $aref ($csvp->get_records) {
        my (@arr) = @{$aref};
        print "@arr\n";
    }

The above program reads the content of a given CSV file and prints the content out in space-separated form.

=head2 Example 2 : Error checking

It is easy to add any error checks using exceptions. One of the easiest ways to do this is to C<use L<Exception::Class>>. We'll modify the CSV parser above to demonstrate that.

    package Text::Parser::CSV;
    use Exception::Class (
        'Text::Parser::CSV::Error', 
        'Text::Parser::CSV::TooManyFields' => {
            isa => 'Text::Parser::CSV::Error',
        },
    );
    
    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    use Text::CSV;

    my $csv;
    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        $csv //= Text::CSV->new({ binary => 1, auto_diag => 1});
        $csv->parse($line);
        my @fields = $csv->fields;
        $self->{__csv_header} = \@fields if not scalar($self->get_records);
        Text::Parser::CSV::TooManyFields->throw(error => "Too many fields on line #" . $self->lines_parsed)
            if scalar(@fields) > scalar(@{$self->{__csv_header}});
        $self->SUPER::save_record(\@fields);
    }

The C<Text::Parser> class will C<close> all filehandles automatically as soon as an exception is thrown from C<save_record>. You can catch the exception in C<main::> as you would normally, by C<use>ing C<L<Try::Tiny>> or other such class.

=head2 Example 3 : Aborting without errors

We can also abort parsing a text file without throwing an exception. This could be if we got the information we needed. For example:

    package Text::Parser::SomeFile;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';

    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        my ($leading, $rest) = split /\s+/, $line, 2;
        return $self->abort_reading() if $leading eq '**ABORT';
        return $self->SUPER::save_record($line);
    }

In this derived class, we have a parser C<Text::Parser::SomeFile> that would save each line as a record, but would abort reading the rest of the file as soon as it reaches a line with C<**ABORT> as the first word. When this parser is given the following file as input:

    somefile.txt:

    Some text is here.
    More text here.
    **ABORT reading
    This text is not read
    This text is not read
    This text is not read
    This text is not read

You can now write a program as follows:

    use Text::Parser::SomeFile;

    my $par = Text::Parser::SomeFile->new();
    $par->read('somefile.txt');
    print $par->get_records(), "\n";

The output will be:

    Some text is here.
    More text here.

=head2 Example 4 : Multi-line parsing

Some text formats allow users to split a line into several lines with a line continuation character (usually at the end or the beginning of a line).

=head3 Trivial line-joiner

Below is a trivial example where all lines are joined into one:

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Text::Parser;

    my $join_all = Text::Parser->new(auto_chomp => 1, multiline_type => 'join_last');
    $join_all->read('input.txt');
    print $join_all->get_records(), "\n";

Another trivial example is L<here|Text::Parser::Multiline/SYNOPSIS>.

=head3 Continue with character

(Pun intended! ;-))

In the above example, all lines are joined (indiscriminately). But most often text formats have a continuation character that specifies that the line continues to the next line, or that the line is a continuation of the I<previous> line. Here's an example parser that treats the back-slash (C<\>) character as a line-continuation character:

    package MyMultilineParser;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    sub new {
        my $pkg = shift;
        $pkg->SUPER::new(multiline_type => 'join_next');
    }

    sub is_line_continued {
        my $self = shift;
        my $line = shift;
        chomp $line;
        return $line =~ /\\\s*$/;
    }

    sub join_last_line {
        my $self = shift;
        my ($last, $line) = (shift, shift);
        chomp $last;
        $last =~ s/\\\s*$/ /g;
        return $last . $line;
    }

    1;

In your C<main::>

    use MyMultilineParser;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    my $parser = MyMultilineParser->new();
    $parser->read('multiline.txt');
    print "Read:\n"
    print $parser->get_records(), "\n";

Try with the following input F<multiline.txt>:

    Garbage In.\
    Garbage Out!

When you run the above code with this file, you should get:

    Read:
    Garbage In. Garbage Out!

=head3 Simple SPICE line joiner

Some text formats allow a line to indicate that it is continuing from a previous line. For example L<SPICE|https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/> has a continuation character (C<+>) on the next line, indicating that the text on that line should be joined with the I<previous> line. Let's show how to build a simple SPICE line-joiner. To build a full-fledged parser you will have to specify the rich and complex grammar for SPICE circuit description.

    use TrivialSpiceJoin;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';

    use constant {
        SPICE_LINE_CONTD => qr/^[+]\s*/,
        SPICE_END_FILE   => qr/^\.end/i,
    };

    sub new {
        my $pkg = shift;
        $pkg->SUPER::new(auto_chomp => 1, multiline_type => 'join_last');
    }

    sub is_line_continued {
        my ( $self, $line ) = @_;
        return 0 if not defined $line;
        return $line =~ SPICE_LINE_CONTD;
    }
    
    sub join_last_line {
        my ( $self, $last, $line ) = ( shift, shift, shift );
        return $last if not defined $line;
        $line =~ s/^[+]\s*/ /;
        return $line if not defined $last;
        return $last . $line;
    }

    sub save_record {
        my ( $self, $line ) = @_;
        return $self->abort_reading() if $line =~ SPICE_END_FILE;
        $self->SUPER::save_record($line);
    }

Try this parser with a SPICE deck with continuation characters and see what you get. Try having errors in the file. You may now write a more elaborate method for C<save_record> above and that could be used to parse a full SPICE file.
