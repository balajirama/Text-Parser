# How to contribute

Welcome! I am glad you consider it worth your time to contribute. Here are some guidelines to follow:

## First:

 1. Open a new issue if it is a bug or even an enhancement, and describe what you are doing and why you think it is important. If it is a major change I would prefer that this is discussed first.
 2. Make your code changes and send me a pull request. This way you will be automatically added as a contributor.
 3. Preferably add tests to ensure that the code coverage is high enough. You can use `Devel::Cover` to add tests that cover all your code changes.

## Please:

 1. Be Polite.
 2. Avoid foul language.
 3. Avoid sexist or racist comments.
 4. Be open to the possibility that your change is not accepted (although I would rarely want to do that).
