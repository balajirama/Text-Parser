=head1 NAME

Text::Parser - Simplifies text parsing. Easily extensible to parse any text format.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.918

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Parser;

    my $parser = Text::Parser->new();
    $parser->read(shift);
    print $parser->get_records, "\n";

The above code reads the first command-line argument as a string, and assuming it is the name of a text file, it will print the content of the file to C<STDOUT>. If the string is not the name of a text file it will throw an exception and exit.

    package MyParser;

    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    ## or use Moose; extends 'Text::Parser';

    sub save_record {
        my $self = shift;
        ## ...
    }

    package main;

    my $parser = MyParser->new(auto_split => 1, auto_chomp => 1, auto_trim => 'b');
    $parser->read(shift);
    foreach my $rec ($parser->get_records) {
        ## ...
    }

The above example shows how C<Text::Parser> could be easily extended to parse a specific text format.

=head1 RATIONALE

Text parsing is perhaps the single most common thing that almost every Perl program does. Yet we don't have a lean, flexible, text parsing utility. Ideally, the developer should only have to specify the "grammar" of the text file she intends to parse. Everything else, like C<open>ing a file handle, C<close>ing the file handle, tracking line-count, joining continued lines into one, reporting any errors in line continuation, trimming white space, splitting each line into fields, etc., should be automatic.

Unfortunately however, most file parsing code looks like this:

    open FH, "<$fname";
    my $line_count = 0;
    while (<FH>) {
        $line_count++;
        chomp;
        $_ = trim $_;  ## From String::Util
        my (@fields) = split /\s+/;
        # do something for each line ...
    }
    close FH;

Note that a developer may have to repeat all of the above if she has to read another file with different content or format. And if the text has line-continuation characters, it isn't easy to implement it well with the C<while> loop above.

With C<Text::Parser>, developers can focus on specifying the grammar and simply use the C<read> method. Just inherit the class and override one method (C<L<save_record|/save_record>>). Voila! you have a parser. L<These examples|/EXAMPLES> illustrate how easy this can be.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Text::Parser> is a format-agnostic text parsing base class. Derived classes can specify the format-specific syntax they intend to parse.

Future versions are expected to include progress-bar support, parsing text from sockets, UTF support, or parsing from a chunk of memory.

=head1 ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS

Several exceptions described in L<Text::Parser::Errors> could be thrown when using C<Text::Parser>. These fall into two broad categories:

=over 4

=item *

Exceptions thrown by C<Text::Parser> itself. All these are derived from C<Text::Parser::Errors::GenericError>.

=item *

Exceptions derived from C<L<Moose::Exception>> thrown when methods of this class are used improperly.

=back

In addition, developers can make their own exceptions. L<This example|/"Example 2 : Error checking"> shows this.

Since the handling of exceptions depends on their type, a dispatch handler routine using L<Dispatch::Class> may be used.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

Takes optional attributes in the form of a hash. See section L<ATTRIBUTES|/ATTRIBUTES> for a list of the attributes and their description. Throws an exception if you use wrong inputs to create an object.

    my $parser = Text::Parser->new(
        auto_chomp      => 0,
        multiline_type  => 'join_last',
        auto_trim       => 'b',
        auto_split      => 1,
        FS              => qr/\s+/,
    );

This C<$parser> variable will be used in all examples below.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The attributes below can be used as options to the C<new> constructor. Each attribute has an accessor with the same name.

=head2 auto_chomp

Read-write attribute. Takes a boolean value as parameter. Defaults to C<0>.

    print "Parser will chomp lines automatically\n" if $parser->auto_chomp;

=head2 auto_split

A set-once-only attribute that can be set only during object construction. Defaults to C<0>. This attribute indicates if the parser will automatically split every line into fields.

If it is set to a true value, each line will be split into fields. Six L<limited access methods|/"LIMITED ACCESS METHODS AVAILABLE IN SUBCLASSES"> (like C<L<field|Text::Parser::AutoSplit/field>>, C<L<find_field|Text::Parser::AutoSplit/find_field>>, etc.) become accessible from within the C<L<save_record|/save_record>> method implemented in the derived class. These methods are documented in L<Text::Parser::AutoSplit>.

=head2 auto_trim

Read-write attribute. The values this can take are shown under the C<L<new|/new>> constructor also. Defaults to C<'n'> (neither side spaces will be trimmed).

    $parser->auto_trim('l');       # 'l' (left), 'r' (right), 'b' (both), 'n' (neither) (Default)

=head2 FS

Read-write attribute that can be used to specify the field separator along with C<auto_split> attribute. It must be a regular expression reference enclosed in the C<qr> function, like C<qr/\s+|[,]/> which will split across either spaces or commas. The default value for this argument is C<qr/\s+/>.

The name for this attribute comes from the built-in C<FS> variable in the popular GNU Awk program.

    $parser->FS( qr/\s+\(*|\s*\)/ );

You I<can> change the field separator in the course of parsing a file. But the changes would take effect only on the next line.

=head2 multiline_type

Takes a value that is either C<undef> or one of strings C<'join_next'> or C<'join_last'>. C<undef> is the default value. If it is one of the last two values, it cannot be set back to C<undef> again.

    $parser->multiline_type(undef);
    $parser->multiline_type('join_next');

    my $mult = $parser->multiline_type;
    print "Parser is a multi-line parser of type: $mult" if defined $mult;

If your text format allows users to break up what should be on a single line into another line using a continuation character, you need to use the C<multiline_type> option.

The option tells the parser to join lines back into a single line, so that your C<save_record> method doesn't have to bother about joining the continued lines, stripping any continuation characters, line-feeds etc.

=over 4

=item *

If your format allows something like a trailing back-slash or some other character to indicate that text on I<B<next>> line is to be joined with this one, then choose C<join_next>. See L<this example|/"Continue with character">.

=item *

If your format allows some character to indicate that text on the current line is part of the I<B<last>> line, then choose C<join_last>. See L<this simple SPICE line-joiner|/"Simple SPICE line joiner"> as an example. B<Note:> If you have no continuation character, but you want to just join all the lines into one single line, then use C<join_last>. See L<this trivial line-joiner|/"Trivial line-joiner">.

=item *

If you want to "slurp" a file into a single large string, without any continuation characters, you must use the C<join_last> multi-line type.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 read

Takes an optional argument, either a string containing the name of the file, or a filehandle reference (a C<GLOB>) like C<\*STDIN> or an object of the C<L<FileHandle>> class.

    $parser->read($filename);

    # The above is equivalent to the following
    $parser->filename($filename);
    $parser->read();

    # You can also read from a previously opened file handle directly
    $parser->filehandle(\*STDIN);
    $parser->read();

Returns once all records have been read or if an exception is thrown, or if reading has been aborted with the C<L<abort_reading|/abort_reading>> method.

If you provide a filename as input, the function will handle all C<open> and C<close> operations on files even if any exception is thrown, or if the reading has been aborted. But if you pass a file handle C<GLOB> or C<FileHandle> object instead, then the file handle won't be closed and it will be the responsibility of the calling program to close the filehandle.

    $parser->read('myfile.txt');
    # Will handle open, parsing, and closing of file automatically.

    open MYFH, "<myfile.txt" or die "Can't open file myfile.txt at ";
    $parser->read(\*MYFH);
    # Will not close MYFH and it is the respo
    close MYFH;

B<Note:> To extend the class to other file formats, override C<L<save_record|/save_record>>.

=head2 filename

Takes an optional string argument containing the name of a file. Returns the name of the file that was last opened if any. Returns C<undef> if no file has been opened.

    print "Last read ", $parser->filename, "\n";

The file name is "persistent" in the object. Meaning, that the C<filename> method remembers the last file that was C<L<read|/read>>.

    $parser->read(shift @ARGV);
    print $parser->filename(), ":\n",
          "=" x (length($parser->filename())+1),
          "\n",
          $parser->get_records(),
          "\n";

A C<read> call with a filehandle, will reset last file name.

    $parser->read(\*MYFH);
    print "Last file name is lost\n" if not defined $parser->filename();

=head2 filehandle

Takes an optional argument, that is a filehandle C<GLOB> (such as C<\*STDIN>) or an object of the C<FileHandle> class. Returns the filehandle last saved, or C<undef> if none was saved.

    my $fh = $parser->filehandle();

Like in the case of C<L<filename|/filename>> method, C<filehandle> is also "persistent" and remembers previous state even after C<read>.

    my $lastfh = $parser->filehandle();
    ## Will return STDOUT
    
    $parser->read('another.txt');
    print "No filehandle saved any more\n" if
                        not defined $parser->filehandle();

=head2 lines_parsed

Takes no arguments. Returns the number of lines last parsed.

    print $parser->lines_parsed, " lines were parsed\n";

Every call of C<read>, causes the value to be auto-reset before parsing a new file.

=head2 get_records

Takes no arguments. Returns an array containing all the records saved by the parser.

    foreach my $record ( $parser->get_records ) {
        $i++;
        print "Record: $i: ", $record, "\n";
    }

=head2 has_aborted

Takes no arguments, returns a boolean to indicate if text reading was aborted in the middle.

    print "Aborted\n" if $parser->has_aborted();

=head2 pop_record

Takes no arguments and pops the last saved record.

    my $last_rec = $parser->pop_record;
    $uc_last = uc $last_rec;
    $parser->save_record($uc_last);

=head2 last_record

Takes no arguments and returns the last saved record. Leaves the saved records untouched.

    my $last_rec = $parser->last_record;

=head1 OVERRIDE IN SUBCLASS

These methods are not expected to be called. Instead they are meant to be overridden in a subclass.

=head2 Method C<this_line>

While these methods are being overridden in a subclass, the developer can expect to be able to use the method C<this_line>. This method takes no arguments and returns the current line being parsed. It has a valid value only for the duration of the C<L<read|/read>> method call, and can be called in any of the methods described under L<this section|/"OVERRIDE IN SUBCLASS">.

=head2 save_record

This method should be re-defined in the subclass. It takes exactly one argument as a record and saves it. All additional arguments are ignored. If no arguments are passed, then C<undef> is stored as a record. It is automatically called within C<L<read|/read>> for each line.

To a developer re-defining this method six additional methods become available if the C<auto_split> attribute is set. These methods are described in greater detail in L<Text::Parser::AutoSplit>.

The developer may store records as anything - string, array reference, hash reference, object of another class - whatever the developer chooses. Since the program that reads these records using C<L<get_records|/get_records>> has to interpret the records, derived classes should document the structure of their records.

=head2 line_auto_manip

A method that could be overridden to manipulate each line before it gets to C<save_record> method. Because this is called before the C<save_record> method, it is called even before the C<Text::Parser::Multiline> role can be called. You will almost never call this method in a program directly but might use it in subclasses.

The default implementation C<chomp>s lines (if C<auto_chomp> is true) and trims leading/trailing whitespace (if C<auto_trim> is not C<'n'>).

If you override this method, remember that it takes a string as input and returns a string.

=head2 FOR MULTI-LINE TEXT PARSING

This method should be re-defined by the derived class and is used only for multi-line parsers. Look under L<FOR MULTI-LINE TEXT PARSING|/"FOR MULTI-LINE TEXT PARSING"> for details.

=head3 is_line_continued

This method should be re-defined in the derived class. Takes a string argument and returns a boolean indicating if the line is continued or not. See L<Text::Parser::Multiline> for more on this.

The default method provided in this class will return as follows:

    multiline_type    |    Return value
    ------------------+---------------------------------
    undef             |         0
    join_last         |    0 for first line, 1 otherwise
    join_next         |         1

=head3 join_last_line

This method should be re-defined in a subclass. The method is expected to take two string arguments and joins them while removing any continuation characters. The default implementation just concatenates two strings and returns the result without removing anything. See L<Text::Parser::Multiline> for more on this.

=head1 FOR USE IN SUBCLASS

=head2 abort_reading

Takes no arguments. Returns C<1>. Never to be called in the main program. To be used only in the derived class. See L<this example|/"Example 3 : Aborting without errors">.

=head1 DON'T OVERRIDE IN SUBCLASS

=head2 push_records

This method is useful if you have to copy the records from another parser.

    $parser->push_records(
        $another_parser->get_records
    );

=head1 DEPRECATED

=head2 setting

This method has been deprecated. Use C<multiline_type> and C<auto_chomp> instead.

I<(Note: This deprecated method cannot be used with the >C<auto_trim>I< attribute)>

I<This method will disappear from version 1.0 onwards.>

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1 : A simple CSV Parser

We will write a parser for a simple CSV file that reads each line and stores the records as array references. This example is oversimplified, and does B<not> handle embedded newlines.

    package Text::Parser::CSV;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    use Text::CSV;

    my $csv;
    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        $csv //= Text::CSV->new({ binary => 1, auto_diag => 1});
        $csv->parse($line);
        $self->SUPER::save_record([$csv->fields]);
    }

That's it! Now in C<main::> you can write something like this:

    use Text::Parser::CSV;
    
    my $csvp = Text::Parser::CSV->new();
    $csvp->read(shift @ARGV);
    foreach my $aref ($csvp->get_records) {
        my (@arr) = @{$aref};
        print "@arr\n";
    }

The above program reads the content of a given CSV file and prints the content out in space-separated form.

=head2 Example 2 : Error checking

I<Note:> Read the documentation for C<L<Exceptions>> to learn about creating, throwing, and catching exceptions in Perl 5. All of the methods of creating, throwing, and catching exceptions described in L<Exceptions> are supported.

You I<can> throw exceptions from C<save_record> in your subclass, for example, when you detect a syntax error. The C<read> method will C<close> all filehandles automatically as soon as an exception is thrown. The exception will pass through to C<::main> unless you catch and handle it in your derived class.

Here is an example showing the use of an exception to detect a syntax error in a file:

    package My::Text::Parser;
    use Exception::Class (
        'My::Text::Parser::SyntaxError' => {
            description => 'syntax error',
            alias => 'throw_syntax_error', 
        },
    );
    
    use parent 'Text::Parser';

    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        throw_syntax_error(error => 'syntax error') if _syntax_error($line);
        $self->SUPER::save_record($line);
    }

=head2 Example 3 : Aborting without errors

We can also abort parsing a text file without throwing an exception. This could be if we got the information we needed. For example:

    package SomeParser;
    use Moose;
    extends 'Text::Parser';

    sub BUILDARGS {
        my $pkg = shift;
        return {auto_split => 1};
    }

    sub save_record {
        my ($self, $line) = @_;
        return $self->abort_reading() if $self->field(0) eq '**ABORT';
        return $self->SUPER::save_record($line);
    }

Above is shown a parser C<SomeParser> that would save each line as a record, but would abort reading the rest of the file as soon as it reaches a line with C<**ABORT> as the first word. When this parser is given the following file as input:

    somefile.txt:

    Some text is here.
    More text here.
    **ABORT reading
    This text is not read
    This text is not read
    This text is not read
    This text is not read

You can now write a program as follows:

    use SomeParser;

    my $par = SomeParser->new();
    $par->read('somefile.txt');
    print $par->get_records(), "\n";

The output will be:

    Some text is here.
    More text here.

=head2 Example 4 : Multi-line parsing

Some text formats allow users to split a line into several lines with a line continuation character (usually at the end or the beginning of a line).

=head3 Trivial line-joiner

Below is a trivial example where all lines are joined into one:

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Text::Parser;

    my $join_all = Text::Parser->new(auto_chomp => 1, multiline_type => 'join_last');
    $join_all->read('input.txt');
    print $join_all->get_records(), "\n";

Another trivial example is L<here|Text::Parser::Multiline/SYNOPSIS>.

=head3 Continue with character

(Pun intended! ;-))

In the above example, all lines are joined (indiscriminately). But most often text formats have a continuation character that specifies that the line continues to the next line, or that the line is a continuation of the I<previous> line. Here's an example parser that treats the back-slash (C<\>) character as a line-continuation character:

    package MyMultilineParser;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    sub new {
        my $pkg = shift;
        $pkg->SUPER::new(multiline_type => 'join_next');
    }

    sub is_line_continued {
        my $self = shift;
        my $line = shift;
        chomp $line;
        return $line =~ /\\\s*$/;
    }

    sub join_last_line {
        my $self = shift;
        my ($last, $line) = (shift, shift);
        chomp $last;
        $last =~ s/\\\s*$/ /g;
        return $last . $line;
    }

    1;

In your C<main::>

    use MyMultilineParser;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    my $parser = MyMultilineParser->new();
    $parser->read('multiline.txt');
    print "Read:\n"
    print $parser->get_records(), "\n";

Try with the following input F<multiline.txt>:

    Garbage In.\
    Garbage Out!

When you run the above code with this file, you should get:

    Read:
    Garbage In. Garbage Out!

=head3 Simple SPICE line joiner

Some text formats allow a line to indicate that it is continuing from a previous line. For example L<SPICE|https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/> has a continuation character (C<+>) on the next line, indicating that the text on that line should be joined with the I<previous> line. Let's show how to build a simple SPICE line-joiner. To build a full-fledged parser you will have to specify the rich and complex grammar for SPICE circuit description.

    use TrivialSpiceJoin;
    use parent 'Text::Parser';

    use constant {
        SPICE_LINE_CONTD => qr/^[+]\s*/,
        SPICE_END_FILE   => qr/^\.end/i,
    };

    sub new {
        my $pkg = shift;
        $pkg->SUPER::new(auto_chomp => 1, multiline_type => 'join_last');
    }

    sub is_line_continued {
        my ( $self, $line ) = @_;
        return 0 if not defined $line;
        return $line =~ SPICE_LINE_CONTD;
    }
    
    sub join_last_line {
        my ( $self, $last, $line ) = ( shift, shift, shift );
        return $last if not defined $line;
        $line =~ s/^[+]\s*/ /;
        return $line if not defined $last;
        return $last . $line;
    }

    sub save_record {
        my ( $self, $line ) = @_;
        return $self->abort_reading() if $line =~ SPICE_END_FILE;
        $self->SUPER::save_record($line);
    }

Try this parser with a SPICE deck with continuation characters and see what you get. Try having errors in the file. You may now write a more elaborate method for C<save_record> above and that could be used to parse a full SPICE file.
