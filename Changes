  - Speed improvement: reduced runtime of read() calls to about 50% of original runtime.
  - Added an initial version of Text::Parser::RuleSpec. Not ready for use yet. Don't use this yet.

0.926     2019-06-21 11:48:08-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

0.925     2019-06-17 07:49:04-07:00 America/Los_Angeles
  - Changed the primary usage model from inheritance-based to regular use in main.
  - A new class for text parsing rules created Text::Parser::Rule (#17).
  - Import functions from String::Util, Scalar::Util, String::Util::Match, String::Util::Range, and String::Index.
